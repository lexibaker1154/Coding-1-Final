Gunner is my dog. He is the cutest dog I have ever seen. I love him so very much. I would not trade him for the world. He is my very best friend. He is so wrinkly. He sleeps all of the time. Sometimes he is hyper and loves to play with his toys. Most of the time he just likes to cuddle and be loved on. We have had Gunner since he was a puppy. I am so thankful that he is my dog. I wish that I could take him to college with me, but the campus does not allow dogs. This is very sad. He gets very sad when people leave him because he just wants to be loved. I am so ready to spend my christmas break with him.
